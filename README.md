# Avonlea

Maybe invoicing. Maybe more. The name itself comes from the farm my family has held in the Mallee region of Victoria. Connotations of working on the land does seem appropriate for a business related app. 

This is a very, very alpha fork/code refactor of some long standing invoicing software I've been using for years for my clients. It is by no means stable, let alone workable. Many dragons & gremlins live here for moment. Long term strategy is:
- [x] Patch to CodeIgniter 3.x branch
- [x] Standardise database between old to new schema for migration purposes
- [x] Apply CI code quality enforcement
- [ ] Remove redundant modules from codebase
- [ ] Add in new modules based on updated/revised invoicing plan
- [ ] Make sure all modules work as planned, using Travis, etc.
- [ ] Create API hooks so other sites can spawn invoices, contracts, quotes using it.
- [ ] Do an official release
